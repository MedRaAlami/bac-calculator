# Bac Calculator ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦

This project is a **Moroccan Baccalaureate calculator** designed to help both Moroccan high school students and foreign students better understand Moroccoâ€™s high school system, specifically the final two years:
- 1st year of Baccalaureate (equivalent to 11th grade in the American system)
- 2nd year of Baccalaureate (equivalent to 12th grade)

### Purpose

The goal of this code is to:
- Introduce the structure of Moroccan high school majors and streams
- Simulate how grades are calculated for the **regional** and **national exams**
- Help students estimate their **overall Baccalaureate score**

This version focuses on the **three main branches** that share similar national exams:
- Sciences
- Economics
- Technologies

Each major has several streams that students can choose in their second year, and the code handles the differences in exam weights accordingly.

### Why This Project?

This project is more than just a calculator â€” itâ€™s also an introduction to the Moroccan school system. Itâ€™s built with future improvements in mind, such as adding more majors, enhancing the user interface, or even converting it into a web app.
